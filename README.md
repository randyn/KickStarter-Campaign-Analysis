# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis

## Background

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success.

## Analysis

In this assignment, I looked at 4,000 past Kickstarter campaigns to try to uncover trends in campaign success. After discussing conclusions that can be drawn and limitations of the analysis, I also mentioned some other analysis that would be interesting to pursue
